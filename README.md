You earn your living by having enough knowledge (theory) and experience
(practice). However, these are expiring assets so you have to keep them fresh.
While honing your knowledge keep in mind these principles:

* Invest regularly - the *habit* itself is more important than the amount
* Diversify - know the ins and outs of the technology you are working with
  currently but *don't stop* there
* Review and rebalance
