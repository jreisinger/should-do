I have no talent. What I do have is a lot of practice. -- John Nunemaker

You earn your living by having enough knowledge (theory) and experience
(practice). However, these are expiring assets so you have to keep them fresh.
While honing your knowledge keep in mind these principles (based on The Pragmatic Programmer):

* Invest regularly - the *habit* itself is as important as the amount
* Diversify - know the ins and outs of the technology you are working with
  currently but *don't stop* there
* Review and rebalance
* Stay current - read news, take classes, go to conferences
* Contribute - QaA, blogs, code
