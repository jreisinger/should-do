There's always more to learn. -- ULSAH, 5th

You earn your living by having enough knowledge (theory) and experience
(practice). However, these are expiring assets so you have to keep them fresh
by applying these principles (based on The Pragmatic Programmer):

* Invest regularly - make learning a *habit* (it is as important as the amount)
* Diversify - know the ins and outs of the technology you are working with
  currently but don't stop there
* Stay current - read news, take classes, go to conferences
* Contribute - QaA, blogs, code
* Review and rebalance - this is a very dynamic industry
* *Think* critically about what you read and hear - be aware of vendors
  interests, media hype, dogma and your project
